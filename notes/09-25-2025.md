# accelerometer


With extremely rare exceptions for the most basic and low-end devices, virtually every modern cell phone—including all smartphones—has a built-in accelerometer. It is a standard and essential component of a smartphone's hardware.

The accelerometer is crucial for many core functions that users now take for granted:

- **Screen orientation**: This sensor automatically rotates the screen from portrait to landscape mode and vice-versa when you turn your device sideways.
- **Motion and gesture detection**: It detects the motion and vibration of the phone, enabling features like a step counter, shaking to undo an action, or flipping the phone over to mute an incoming call.
- **Gaming**: In mobile games, the accelerometer allows users to control gameplay by tilting the device, such as in racing games.
- **Location tracking and navigation**: In conjunction with a gyroscope, a magnetometer (compass), and GPS, the accelerometer provides more accurate and responsive location services. 

## Accelerometer vs. gyroscope

While many modern smartphones also include a gyroscope for more precise motion tracking, the accelerometer is more fundamental. 
|Feature 	| Accelerometer	 | Gyroscope
| ----------|----------------|------------------
|Measures	| Linear acceleration and orientation relative to gravity.	| Rotational motion and angular velocity.
|Presence	| Found in almost all modern smartphones, as it is simple and inexpensive to produce.	| Often found alongside an |accelerometer in higher-end or more recent smartphones.
|Function	| Enables screen rotation and simple motion tracking, like counting steps.	| Detects fine rotational movements for more advanced features like immersive VR, precise gaming, and image stabilization.

## Smartphone + Smartwatch

The combination of sensors in a smartwatch and a smartphone can be used to detect rowing strokes and calculate stroke rate, though the smartphone is not necessary for the primary stroke detection. A smartwatch alone is capable of performing this task with sufficient accuracy for many users. The effectiveness of this setup depends on the specific hardware and software used. 

### Advantages of using both devices

Using both a smartwatch and a smartphone offers a more robust tracking experience than a single device.
- Better sensor fusion: Combining data from both devices (sensor fusion) can increase the accuracy of stroke detection. For example, the smartwatch can track the specific motion of the wrist and handle, while the phone (if mounted to the boat) could track the overall acceleration of the vessel.
- Watch-only convenience: Many rowing apps allow for the smartwatch to be used on its own for stroke detection. The watch collects all the data and later syncs with the phone for analysis, keeping the rower's arms free and unencumbered.
- Enhanced display: The phone can act as a more detailed and easily visible display for real-time rowing stats. For indoor rowing, this can be especially useful.
- Data redundancy: If one device fails or runs out of battery, the other may have enough information to provide a backup record of the workout. 


## Software and apps

The key to calculating the stroke rate is a specialized 
application that can interpret the sensor data. A standard fitness app may not have the specific algorithms to accurately differentiate a rowing stroke from other arm movements.

### Existing apps
- CrewNerd: This is an established app for both Apple and Android that specializes in on-water and indoor rowing, using the sensors in smart devices to track performance metrics like stroke rate.
- Rowing in Motion: This app for iOS and Android uses a smartphone's sensors to measure stroke rate, boat acceleration, and speed when the device is mounted to the shell.
- Garmin apps: Garmin watches have built-in rowing activities that use the watch's motion sensors to track and display stroke rate. 

### Potential drawbacks
- Positioning sensitivity: The accuracy of sensor-based detection is sensitive to the device's position. An app that relies on wrist movement will produce a different stroke reading than one mounted on the boat or rowing machine.
- Accuracy during variation: Certain rowing drills or changes in stroke style can confuse the detection algorithms, leading to a less accurate stroke count.
- GPS drift: For on-water rowing, GPS can sometimes produce inaccurate readings of speed and distance if the boat is stationary, which can affect overall metric calculations. 


## App vs. Speedcoach

### GPS technology
-Higher update rate: The SpeedCoach uses a high-precision 5 Hz GPS receiver, which receives and updates position data from satellites five times every second. In contrast, most smartphones and even general-purpose GPS watches have a 1 Hz refresh rate, updating just once per second.
- Superior responsiveness: The faster update rate of the SpeedCoach allows for a more responsive and accurate display of your real-time speed and distance, especially when your pace changes rapidly.
- Specialized purpose: Since the SpeedCoach is designed for a boat, it accounts for the unique movements of rowing and paddling. It provides specialized metrics like split time (pace per 500 meters) and distance per stroke (glide) that a smartphone's general-purpose GPS tracking cannot accurately measure.
- No signal interference: For team sports like rowing, a SpeedCoach can be mounted to a rigger or foot stretcher where it has a clear view of the sky. A smartphone carried by a rower can have its GPS signal blocked by their body or the bodies of other crew members, leading to less reliable data. 

### Accelerometer technology
- Stroke rate precision: The SpeedCoach uses its accelerometer to measure your stroke rate wirelessly. Its accelerometer has been extensively tested and tuned over years specifically for rowing and paddling strokes, allowing it to provide a more accurate reading than a smartphone.
- Adjustable settings: Advanced SpeedCoach models allow you to modify accelerometer sensitivity settings. This lets you calibrate the device to accurately detect both a beginner's or an elite athlete's strokes, something not possible with a smartphone.
- Integration with other sensors: In addition to its internal accelerometer and GPS, a SpeedCoach can connect to an impeller (a wired sensor in the water) for even more accurate speed measurements, which accounts for water currents. This capability is specific to marine applications and is not possible with a smartphone.
