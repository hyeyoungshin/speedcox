# Singleton Obj vs Class for Models

### Singleton Objects
```javascript
const SensorModel = {
    motionPermission: false,
    
    enableMotion() {
        this.motionPermission = true;
    }
};

// Direct usage - ONE shared instance
SensorModel.enableMotion();
```

### Class
```javascript
class SensorsModel {
    constructor() {
        this.motionPermission = false;
    }
    
    enableMotion() {
        this.motionPermission = true;
    }
}

// Must instantiate - can have MULTIPLE instances
const sensors = new SensorsModel();
sensors.enableMotion();
```

### Advantages of the Singleton Object Version

1. Simpler - No new keyword, no instantiation ceremony
2. One Instance - You only ever need ONE sensor model per app
3. Globally Accessible - Easy to import and use anywhere
4. No this Binding Issues - Methods always know their context
5. Lighter Weight - No prototype chain overhead
6. Direct Reset - SensorModel.reset() directly modifies the singleton

### Disadvantages of the Class Version
1. Shared State - If you import it in multiple files, they share the same state (but this is what you want!)
2. Can't Create Fresh Instance - Must manually reset instead of new SensorsModel()
3. Harder to Test - Need to reset state between tests (but you have reset() method)


### When to Use Class Instead:
Use classes if you ever need:

Multiple workouts tracked simultaneously
A/B testing different sensor configurations
Undo/redo with different state snapshots

But for a single-workout rowing app? The singleton object version is better.

# MVC refactoring and app.js

A new architecture:
```
speedcox/
├── index.html              # Main HTML structure (view only)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css          # All styling
├── js/
│   ├── app.js              # Main app controller
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── workout.js      # Workout data model
│   │   └── sensors.js      # Sensor data management
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── gps.js          # GPS tracking logic
│   │   ├── motion.js       # Motion sensor logic

├── manifest.json           # PWA manifest
└── sw.js                   # Service worker
```

### Modern Software Architecture:

Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with clear separation of concerns  
Modular design with specialized components for GPS tracking, motion detection, and audio feedback  
Service-oriented architecture for stroke detection algorithms and data persistence  
Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline functionality and native-like experience  
Installable on any device without app store requirements  


### Iterative Refactoring Order:

1. Models (DONE) - Foundation layer with no dependencies
2. Utils (NEXT) - Pure functions with no state, used by everyone
3. Services - Business logic that uses models and utils
4. Controllers - Coordinate between services and models
5 App.js (LAST) - Final cleanup, just UI binding and orchestration

_Why Iterative is Better?_

1. Complexity Management: Your file has intricate interdependencies (GPS updates trigger stroke detection, which affects display, which triggers audio, etc.). Doing it all at once risks breaking these connections.  
2. Testing Between Steps: You can test after each refactoring step to ensure everything still works before moving to the next layer.  
3. Easier Debugging: If something breaks, you know exactly which refactoring caused it.  
4. Clearer Decision Making: As we refactor, we might discover that some functions belong in different places than initially planned.

_Each step we can_

- Extract the relevant code
- Keep all documentation
- Create a simple test/verification strategy
- Make sure nothing breaks

_The refactoring flow should be_

1. Extract models, controllers, services, utils (keeping app-old.js untouched)
2. Create NEW app.js that uses all the extracted modules
3. Test the new modular version
4. Delete app-old.js only when everything works

# app.js (Main Application Controller)

## Orchestration:

- Imports all modules
- Initializes controllers with callbacks
- Coordinates data flow between models/controllers
- Manages UI updates and event handlers

## Key Features:

- Loads settings from storage on startup
- Initializes all controllers (GPS, Motion, Audio)
- Starts/stops workouts with proper lifecycle
- Handles GPS updates → updates WorkoutModel → triggers stroke detection
- Handles motion data → updates SensorModel → detects strokes
- Updates display every 100ms with current metrics
- Manages audio announcements based on intervals
- Shows workout summary and saves to history
- Persists settings when changed

## Data Flow Example (GPS Stroke Detection):
```
GPS Hardware
    ↓ (position update)
GPSController.handlePositionUpdate()
    ↓ (callback)
app.handleGPSUpdate()
    ↓ (updates)
WorkoutModel.totalDistance += distance
WorkoutModel.speedHistory.push()
    ↓ (analyzes)
GPSController.analyzeSpeedForStrokes()
    ↓ (uses)
StrokeDetectionService.gps.detectSpeedPeak()
    ↓ (if peak detected)
WorkoutModel.gpsStrokeRate = rate
SensorModel.setGPSStrokeRate(rate)
    ↓ (display update)
app.updateStrokeRateDisplay()
    ↓ (renders)
UI shows stroke rate
```

## Benefits of New Architecture:

1. Separation of Concerns - Each file has one clear responsibility
2. Testability - Pure functions and isolated modules easy to test
3. Maintainability - Changes localized to specific files
4. Reusability - Services and utils can be used elsewhere
5. Scalability - Easy to add new features (e.g., heart rate monitor)
6. Clarity - Clear data flow and dependencies



## The Critical Change - type="module"
```javascript
// OLD WAY (global scope)
<script src="app-old.js"></script>
// Variables in app-old.js are global, can conflict

// NEW WAY (module scope)
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
// Variables in app.js are private
// Only exports are accessible
```

### What type="module" does:

- Enables ES6 import/export statements
- Creates a module scope (variables don't leak globally)
- Automatically defers script execution until DOM is ready
- Allows browser to load dependencies automatically

### How Module Loading Works
When the browser loads app.js with type="module":
1.  Browser loads app.js
2. Browser sees: import WorkoutModel from './models/workout.js'
3. Browser automatically loads ./models/workout.js
4. Browser sees: import { calculateDistance } from '../utils/calculations.js'
5. Browser loads that too
6. ... continues for all imports
7. Once all dependencies loaded, executes app.js

### Module Scope
With modules, variables are scoped:
```javascript
// OLD WAY (global scope)
<script src="app-old.js"></script>
// Variables in app-old.js are global, can conflict

// NEW WAY (module scope)
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
// Variables in app.js are private
// Only exports are accessible
```

### CORS Requirement
Important: Modules require a web server (can't use file:// protocol)

Option A - Python (built-in):
```bash
# In your project directory
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open: http://localhost:8000
```

Option B - Node.js:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
# Open: http://localhost:8080
```

Option C - VS Code Live Server Extension:
- Install "Live Server" extension
- Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"

## Testing
1. Start a local server (use one of the options above)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for these logs:
```
Initializing Speedcox...
Audio controller initialized
GPS available
Motion controller initialized
Settings loaded
Speedcox initialized successfully
```
