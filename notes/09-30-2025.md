# architecture options

## Option 1: Keep Current (Pure Frontend)

### Pros:

- Simple deployment (one HTML file)
- No server needed
- Works offline
- Fast to iterate

### Cons:

- All logic in JavaScript (you prefer Scala)
- Harder for me to debug

## Option 2: Scala Backend + HTML Frontend

```
Phone (HTML/JS) → WebSocket → Scala Server
                ↓
        Receives GPS/Motion data
                ↓
        Scala processes logic
                ↓
        Sends back metrics
```

### Pros:

- Logic in Scala (my comfort zone)
- Better for complex algorithms
- Can store workout data in database

### Cons:

- Need to run a server
- More complex deployment
- Requires internet connection
- Phone sends GPS data to server


## Option 3: Hybrid
Keep simple logic in JS, complex logic in Scala:

- Basic GPS/motion collection in JS
- Send raw data to Scala backend
- Scala does stroke detection algorithms
- Returns processed metrics

# stroke detection and rate calculation methods

| Sensor | What It Detects | Good For| 
|--------|-----------------|---------|
|Accelerometer | Phone movement, shaking, rowing motion| Direct stroke detection|
|GPS | Location, speed, distance | Speed patterns, distance tracking

### What's in modern mobile devices

**Motion Sensors:**

- Accelerometer - Detects acceleration/movement in 3 axes (x, y, z)
- Gyroscope - Detects rotation/orientation changes
- Magnetometer - Detects magnetic field (compass)

**GPS:**

- GPS receiver - Satellite positioning for location/speed
- GLONASS/Galileo - Additional satellite systems for accuracy
- A-GPS - Assisted GPS using cell towers

### Which method works better?

**Motion Sensor Method:**

- Pros: Instant stroke detection, works without moving far
- Cons: Requires boat to pitch/rock, sensitive to phone mounting

**GPS Method (NK SpeedCoach):**

- Pros: Reliable, not affected by mounting, industry standard
- Cons: Requires actual movement, speed-based (indirect)

# Web-based App (Web App) vs. Mobile App

There are different application types possible for Speedcox:

1. Web-Based Application (What Speedcox Is Currently)

Runs in a web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)   
Written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
Access via URL (like https://yourname.github.io/speedcox)  
Can be installed as PWA (looks/feels like native app)  
No app store needed  

2. Native Mobile App (What Speedcox Is NOT)

Separate iOS app (App Store) and Android app (Google Play)  
Written in Swift/Kotlin or React Native  
Downloaded and installed from app stores  
Runs directly on phone OS (not in browser)


3. Progressive Web App - PWA (What Speedcox Actually Is)

Web-based BUT can be "installed" on home screen  
Looks like native app when installed  
Works offline  
Access to phone sensors (GPS, accelerometer)  
Best of both worlds!?
